# Webpage sectional animation framework

An animation framework prototype/proof-of-concept (PoC) that allows you to animate in section elements on a webpage with many sections.

This set of requirements is for a particular project so it is very specific & in its entirity might not be applicable to other projects, but parts of it might be useful to repurpose.
